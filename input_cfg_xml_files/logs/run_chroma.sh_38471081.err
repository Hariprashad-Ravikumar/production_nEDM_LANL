Unloading the cpe module is insufficient to restore the system defaults.
Please run 'source
/opt/cray/pe/cpe/24.07/restore_lmod_system_defaults.[csh|sh]'. 

The following have been reloaded with a version change:
  1) gcc-native/13.2 => gcc-native/12.3


Lmod is automatically replacing "gcc-native/12.3" with "gcc/12.2.0".


The following have been reloaded with a version change:
  1) PrgEnv-gnu/8.5.0 => PrgEnv-gnu/8.3.3
  2) cray-dsmml/0.3.0 => cray-dsmml/0.2.2
  3) cray-libsci/24.07.0 => cray-libsci/23.02.1.1

  5) craype/2.7.32 => craype/2.7.19

Lmod has detected the following error: The following module(s) are unknown:
"python/3.9-anaconda-2021.11"

Please check the spelling or version number. Also try "module spider ..."
It is also possible your cache file is out-of-date; it may help to try:
  $ module --ignore_cache load "python/3.9-anaconda-2021.11"

Also make sure that all modulefiles written in TCL start with the string
#%Module
